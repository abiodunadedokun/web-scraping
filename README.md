# web-scraping
This is a mini-project to demonstrate my skills in web scraping. The project aims to retrieve the list of the largest companies in the United States by revenue, from the website 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue'.   The retrieved data will be stored in pandas dataframe and .csv file for further data analysis. 

Tools: Python, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, Requests
